# 🛍️ MERN Stack E-Commerce Website

I have built a MERN Stack E-Commerce Website. The frontend is developed using React.js, and the backend is implemented only for authentication (user login/register and admin login) using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Features like cart functionality, product filtering, and shopping operations are implemented on the frontend. This project is mainly frontend-focused, with backend integration used specifically for authentication."
